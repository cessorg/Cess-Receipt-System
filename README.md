# Cess-Receipt-System
This is webapp which will transform reciepts of CESS from offline to online. This will help in automation. As CESS organizes many events, most of which are paid, require participants to get entry pass of event. The entire process of registeration had to be manually managed. Some of the major drawback of this approach are making participation list for every event and checking genuineness of receipt.
So changing offline system to online using computerized approach will help overcome these problems.
