# Cess-Receipt-System
This is webapp which will transform reciepts of CESS from offline to online. This will help in automation. As CESS organizes many events and most of events are paid So, they require participant to get reciept of event which also worked as entry pass of event. In this all we manually had to issue a reciept which is generated on RecieptBook(offline). The Biggest problem faced in this approach was about making participation list of one event as we need to see  all reciepts and also genuineness of receipt was also problem.
So changing offline system to online using computerized approach wil overcome this problems.
